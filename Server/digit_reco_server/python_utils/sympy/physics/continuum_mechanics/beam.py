    A Beam is a structural element that is capable of withstanding load
    primarily by resisting against bending. Beams are characterized by
    their cross sectional profile(Second moment of area), their length
    and their material.

    .. note::
       While solving a beam bending problem, a user should choose its
       own sign convention and should stick to it. The results will
       automatically follow the chosen sign convention.


    Examples
    ========
    There is a beam of length 4 meters. A constant distributed load of 6 N/m
    is applied from half of the beam till the end. There are two simple supports
    below the beam, one at the starting point and another at the ending point
    of the beam. The deflection of the beam at the end is restricted.

    Using the sign convention of downwards forces being positive.
