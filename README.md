# Handwritten Equation Solver Application

## ToDo

- [ ] Make a Server for Digit Recognition
- [ ] Make a client App for Digit Recognition

## Technologies/Frameworks Used
### Server
- Keras
- Nodejs
- Express
- Keras-js
- multer
- pngjs
- Other common python libraries : numpy, matplotlib etc
- Other common npm libraries : bodyparser, fs, path etc
### Client
ToDo

## Prerequisites
### Following must be installed
- Keras
- Nodejs<br>
    Run `npm init` in `Server/digit_reco_server` to install :
    - keras-js
    - pngjs
    - multer
    - Other common nodejs libraries like express etc
- h5py - To enable storing models on disk
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Server

The server is built on Nodejs. The Multi-layer perceptron model is built using Keras.
<br><br>
### 1. Build the model using Keras
```
cd Server/digit_reco_server/keras_model
python data_gen.py
python encoder.py models_generated/model.hdf5
```

Doing this will :
1. Download the MNIST dataset
2. Construct a simple multi layer perceptron model trained on MNIST dataset
3. Store the model in `models_generated` folder in a format that can be used by `keras-js` for prediction

### 2. Start the server
```
cd Server/digit_reco_server
npm start
```

### 3. Upload Image
Properties of image to be uploaded :
- Dimensions : 28 X 28
- Format : png (with data in RGBA)

Images can be generated from MNIST dataset using `Utilities/image_gen.py` :
```
cd Utilities
python image_gen.py
```
Images are saved in `Utilities/Images` folder. These images can be uploaded into the server when launched. Any image uploaded must have same properties as those generated by `image_gen.py`
<br>
Upon uploading, the server returns the predicted digit in the image.
<br>
**Route used** : `/imgupload`<br>
This route should be used by any client application that uses this server.
